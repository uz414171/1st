# Frequency Scanner

This Python script allows you to tune to specified frequencies and channels using the Sceptre REST API. It logs each tuning action to a CSV file and continues scanning through the frequencies and channels until manually stopped.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `sceptrerestapi` module
- `requests` module

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the script directly.
2. Ensure you have the required Python modules installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install sceptrerestapi requests
```

## Usage

### Running the Script

To run the script, use the following command:

```bash
python3 frequency_scanner.py
```

### Inputting Frequencies and Channels

1. The script will prompt you to enter frequencies in MHz and their corresponding channels.
2. Enter the frequency and channel pairs one after another. For example:

```
Enter the frequency in MHz (or type 'done' to finish): 100
Enter the channel: 1
Enter the frequency in MHz (or type 'done' to finish): 200
Enter the channel: 2
```

3. Type `done` when you have finished entering all the frequencies and channels.

### Starting the Scan

- After you finish inputting the frequencies and channels, the script will start scanning.
- The script will tune to each frequency and channel pair, log the activity to `activity_log.csv`, and continue indefinitely.
- To stop the scan, press `Ctrl+C`.

### CSV Logging

The script logs each tuning action to a CSV file named `activity_log.csv`. The file contains two columns: `Frequency (Hz)` and `Channel`.

## Example

Here's an example of how the script might run:

```bash
$ python3 frequency_scanner.py
Enter frequencies in MHz and corresponding channels. Type 'done' when finished.
Enter the frequency in MHz (or type 'done' to finish): 100
Enter the channel: 1
Enter the frequency in MHz (or type 'done' to finish): 200
Enter the channel: 2
Enter the frequency in MHz (or type 'done' to finish): done
Starting scan. Press Ctrl+C to stop.
Tuning to 100000000.0 Hz on Channel 1
Tuning to 200000000.0 Hz on Channel 2
...
```

## Notes

- Ensure you have proper permissions and access to the Sceptre REST API.
- Adjust the sleep time in the script if necessary to match your requirements.
